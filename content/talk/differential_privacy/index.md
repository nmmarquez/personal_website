abstract: The US Census Bureau has growing concern that with the rise of publicly available data on individuals, that information from the census may be at risk for re-identification. As a preemptive measure  to mitigate the risk of re-identification the bureau is moving forward with implementing a version of epsilon differential privacy for the 2020 Census. In this panel session my colleague, Lee Fiorio, will outline the bureau's rough plan for implementation, potential consequences, and give a brief outline of measures we are concerned may be affected by differential privacy.
