abstract: Though net migration of Mexican nationals into the United States is near zero, there is a continued geographic redistribution of the population. While most theories of settlement focus on changes that alter patterns of migration across the border, this talk begins to analyze the different contextual factors that influence Mexican national migration within the United States and how this may lead to different geographic patterns of migration events. In addition, we examine how migration events differ in their demographics from previous periods as well as fracturing in the patterns of migration between Mexican nationals and US-born Hispanics.
